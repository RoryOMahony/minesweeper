# Minesweeper

## Project Aims:

- To create a game that resembed the old minesweeper game found on Windows systems
- Learn what the different React hooks are and how they should be used by components
- Learn how to correctly update state using react hooks

### Improvements/Enchancements

- The project has been designed for desktop only and could be updated to work on mobile
- Basic icons have been used and could be replaced with images/sprites
- The project css could be updated to make the game/components more responsive
- The code in the reducer could be refactored to reduce the size of the class
- The game does not handle large grids size well (e.g. 100x100) and there is a noticeable delay when the game is interacted with at these larger grid sizes. Dev tools have shown this to be due to the amount of components being re-rendered when the game state is updated
- In the old Minesweeper game a player could uncover surrounding cells by pressing both the right and left mouse buttons at the same time. This project uses a double click for this functionality, but could include this feature
